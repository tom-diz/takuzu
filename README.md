# Takuzu Project - A small but interesting game.
## Discipline : Introduction to the C language

### Description

Made in May 2022.

The goal of this project is to create a Takuzu game, a similar type of the famous Sudoku game found in books, mobile apps, except that instead, this game uses 0s and 1s only.
The program can generate a grid, resolve a grid (if it is possible) and the user can choose whether to use those options, or to play a game of Takuzu.
Keep in mind that this program can only be ran on Windows.
